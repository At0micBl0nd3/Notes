Kinds of web extensions (look this word up if you aren't sure what it means)
js/css/html/php/flask (flask is not an extension)

php- What most websites are written in, it contains html which can be viewed and edited by the client. 
However, the PHP code itself cannot be viewed or edited by the client.
(this is where most flags are)
flask- Python's version of creating web pages, easier to understand after CS210

js- JavaScript file, executes code dynamically on web page
css- cascading style sheets, makes the website look nice
html- some files have no PHP, not common in CTFs though

possibilities:
-source
--right click/view source
# Important linux command for later, downloads all source code related to url
wget -r [url] -l0 = spider command 

-cookies
--EditThisCookie
--Burpsuite and FoxyProxy

-URL Injection (look up commix if you have time)
--robots.txt
--/flag
--/admin
--../../../../../etc/passwd

-SQL
--sqlmap
--https://2017game.picoctf.com
--long,grueling process
-- ', ", `, --, or '1'='1, junk' UNION SELECT 1,1,login,1,1,1 FROM users
--find version
--enumerate tables and colums by looking at respective schema tables

------harder------ (look these up if you're curious but they won't be in the assigned problems)
-xml (good writeup- http://shpik.tistory.com/78) (MonsterDex on Cyberstakes) (tell me if you don't have that unlocked and you want to try it)
-xss (https://alf.nu/alert1) (https://gokulkrishna01.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/admin-i-web-100-xss-sect-ctf-2016/)
-type casting
-remote code execution
-using hyrda (very rare to have to do password guessing)
--if a page says "your note will be checked by admin" it is most likely javascript/xss
